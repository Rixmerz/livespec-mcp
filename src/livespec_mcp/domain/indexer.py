"""Project indexer: walks workspace, extracts symbols+refs, persists to SQLite,
and resolves call edges by name matching.

Design (post-P1.3 v2): refs are persisted in `symbol_ref` because partial
re-index needs to re-resolve refs from UNCHANGED files when their target is
in a file that did change — without persistence, those edges would vanish
permanently. Cascade on symbol delete keeps the ref table consistent.

Resolve is INSERT OR IGNORE only (never DELETE) so existing edges from
unchanged files are always preserved."""
